# SI507_final

Code is in 2 parts: data acquisition in si507_final_project.ipynb, process and presentation in slzheng_presentation.py.

Downloaded colab notebook encounters a format problem. If you have issue executing my code, please tell me and I'll share permission to my notebook online.

I've hidden the mal_client.py file which holds myAnimelist.net client id and secret. This file is only used to enable myAnimelist.net API and fetch anime.csv data. If you want to test this part, please tell me and I'll share this file.

I've shared the .csv and .sqlite file for the streamlit application to run.

To run the presentation, simply run "streamlit run slzheng_presentation.py".
